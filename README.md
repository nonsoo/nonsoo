# Sup Everyone, Nonso Here!

I'm a front-end web developer that likes breaking things on the web -- haha! All jokes aside, I'm a fairly curious person that loves building stuff, especially software that allows others to build upon their ideas. Although, I can't continue this intro without giving a shout-out to French class -- Yes, absolutely, I started coding because of French class ✌️.

I'm interested in seeing how different layouts are integrated on the web and so I've got to give props to CSS for showing me the way. But to be more specific, can we take layouts originally intended for print and bring them to a web experience? If so, how would that interaction look? What sort of user experiences could be made possible? Could we create custom experiences for users to explore?

I come from a science background and so I love asking questions!! One very important question is... Do pineapples go on pizza?

Do let me know over on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/codingnorm) and feel free to pursue the [blog](https://dev.to/nonsoo). 

**I think programming combines the best of creativity with technical skills!!! Also, I get to build whatever I want, whenever I want!**
