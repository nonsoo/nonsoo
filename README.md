# Sup Everyone, Nonso Here!

I'm a front-end web developer that likes breaking things -- haha! All jokes aside, I'm a fairly curious person that loves building stuff and I'm interested in seeing how different layouts are integrated on the web. How can we take layouts that were originally for print and bring them to the world of the web? How can we create custom experiences for users to explore?

Iâ€™m also interested in building applications that have clean user interfaces which are unobtrusive and do not compromise on user experience -- People have busy lives and if a website is not intuitive, that bounce rate is going up!

I think programming combines the best of creativity with technical skills!!! Also, I get to build whatever I want, whenever I want!
