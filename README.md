# 👋 Hi, I’m @nonsoo, a front end web developer interested in how different layouts are integrated on the web. 
- 👀 I’m interested to building applications that are clean user interfaces that is unobtrusive and does not compromise on user experience. I’m slowly but surely branching into iOS development and learning swift how to build applications with SwiftUI.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any front end web development projects that are mainly in react.
